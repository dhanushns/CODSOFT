# CODSOFT
Welcome to the official repository for my JavaScript Developer internship activities at Codsoft! In this repository, I'll be sharing the projects, tasks, and assignments I've completed during my internship journey.

# Todo List

Welcome to the Todo List project! This is a web application designed and developed as part of my internship activities at Codsoft. The project aims to create an interactive and user-friendly todo list website with unique features tailored to enhance task management and productivity.

## Features:
- **Add Sections**: Organize your tasks into different sections for better categorization and prioritization.
- **Add Tasks to Specific Sections**: Assign tasks to specific sections to keep your todo list well-organized.
- **History Tracking**: Keep track of the tasks created and completed with a built-in history feature.
- **Update Existed Tasks**: Easily update existing tasks to modify details or mark them as completed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from your todo list when they are no longer relevant or necessary.

## Inspiration:
At the beginning of the development process, I had no predefined design or functionalities for the project. To kickstart the project, I searched for todo list examples on the internet and came across the Todoist website. Inspired by its sleek design and intuitive features, I decided to incorporate some of its functionalities into my project while adding unique elements tailored to my skills and vision.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
